# Title: Super Resolution of images using SRGAN

## Authors : Srikanth Babu Mandru

## Summary 

Data being the modern world's electricity, it's driving as fuel in many applications ranging from Medical, Industries, businesses. One of major issues with systems depending on data is 'Data' itself. There might be a lot of descrepencies in the quality of data available to use. This is true, especially in computer vision field, where the images or videos available to use are not upto the requirement and resulting in less efficiencies of the systems. As the data and technology evolves, there is need of technique that acts as fast fuel for improving the efficiencies of existing or other techniques used for different appilcations. For all the computer vision related problems, images or videos that we input makes a huge deal in alleviating the overall performance. It is highly challenging task to estimate a high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. It is often referred to as an 'Super-Resolution' (SR). SR received substantial attention from within the computer vision research community and has a wide range of applications.

Initially, the project aims at implementing the SRGAN model to solve Super Resolution(SR) problem. I have taken dataset named 'DIV2K' [[Dataset link]](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/), which is one of the popular datasets for image resolution task. Later, I try to incorporate other datasets for training making the model more robust. 

Applications :

TV resolution or movie resolution,
Face Recognition,
Autonomous vehicle driving,
Medical, 
Security Systems,
Gaming and Graphics design.

## Proposed plan of research

This project focuses on solving the SR problem through 2 phases. First phase of project mainly exploring the ideas of GAN architectures and understanding the merits of using SRGAN. At this phase, I will also concentrate developing SRGAN model using the Tensorflow, Keras and other Machine learning APIs. In the second phase, I will take the training of model to google cloud platform using the google storage and compute engines. Over the entire project cycle, I do some research on building other architectures for improving the performance of SR. Strong focus on Deep learning techinques. 

## Preliminary Results

Images of low res and high res.
